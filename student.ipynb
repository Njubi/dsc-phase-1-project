    "# Microsoft Movie Studio Proposal Project\n",
    "\n",
    "## Author: Nicholas Njubi\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they don’t know anything about creating movies. I have been charged with exploring what  films are currently doing the best at the box office. I must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    " For this project I chose to major on the following business problems\n",
    " \n",
    " 1) Whether their is a correlation between film runtime and average rating? Also what film runtime would I advise?\n",
    " This is because Microsoft what other industry experts are doing and how this would affect their ratings. I a film is\n",
    " too short the viewer might feel it was rushed while if it was too long they would not want to watch it.\n",
    " \n",
    " 2) Which movie genres had the best average rating?\n",
    " Microsoft is still debating on which genre/ genre's to focus on. This analysis will allow us to know what the viewers like\n",
    " most so that we can tailor make it for the market.\n",
    " \n",
    " 3) What are the top 10 highest grossing films?\n",
    " A big factor of business is profits. Microsoft Movie studios wants to understand which are the top 10 highest grossing films.\n",
    " Later on this report will be given to the marketing and research department who we will work together to do a much deeper analysis on each of the movies in the top 10 list.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "For this analysis I had access to the data from the following websites which offer movie streaming and rating services\n",
    "\n",
    "1) https://www.the-numbers.com/\n",
    "\n",
    "2) https://www.themoviedb.org/\n",
    "\n",
    "3) https://www.rottentomatoes.com/\n",
    "\n",
    "4) https://www.imdb.com/\n",
    "\n",
    "5) https://www.boxofficemojo.com/\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose to work with the following data set\n",
    "\n",
    "a) \"title.basics.csv\", because it had information on genres and movie titles\n",
    "\n",
    "b) \"title.ratings.csv\", because it could be easily merged with \"title.basics.csv\" and had\n",
    "information on average rating\n",
    "\n",
    "c)\"bom.movie_gross.csv\", because it had information on domestic and foreign gross of films.\n",

    "I choose to create a scatter plot because my goal was to see the correlation between runtime and averagerating. To do this I first had to create a new dataframe \"total_combined_abv_aver_df\" first. This is because I realized that some of the movies had very few number of votes, I felt the best step moving forward was to remove the rows whose number of votes were below average.\n",
